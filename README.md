Multi-level inverters (MLI) have been widely used for dc to ac power conversion for different applications. Different PWM methods are used to control the multilevel inverters. Among various PWM methods, space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) is the superior method. As the number of level increases, the execution of space vector modulation (SVPWM) for multilevel inverters is difficult. A basic space vector modulation scheme is applied to three phase three level NPC in which dwell time calculation is done for one sector only, and same can be mapped for other sectors. Simulation and experimental results are presented for performance validation.
